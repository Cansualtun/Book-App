## How to Start Contribute

We created our frontend application and that is our public assets. So, we use express static (in server.js) to serve them as our public assets. 
By doing that, we can use our app on localhost:5000

Before you start

- git clone 
- npm install (also in client files)
- create new branch

After the changes

- merge with master
- create pull request
- delete branch
