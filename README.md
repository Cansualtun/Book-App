- git clone https://github.com/Cansualtun/Books-App.git
- create .env file
- setup values for MONGO_URL, JWT_SECRET, JWT_LIFETIME in .env
- npm install && npm start

We created our frontend application and that is our public assets. So, we use express static (in server.js) to serve them as our public assets. 
By doing that, we can use our app on localhost:5000
